/**
 * The Russian letter rows are byte-for-byte the Tatar ones.
 *
 * That is deliberate, not an accident of copy-paste: the Russian layout carries the same Tatar
 * long-press duplicates (у→ү, н→ң, х→һ, а→ә, о→ө, ж→җ …) so a bilingual user gets the Tatar
 * letters without switching layouts. The only difference between the two layouts lives in
 * `rowkeys_tatar_extra.xml` — the visible fifth row of ә ө ү җ ң һ, which the Russian layout
 * does not have.
 *
 * Because the three shared files are identical, editing one side without the other silently
 * desynchronises the layouts, and nothing else in the tree would notice. This test is the guard:
 * any one-sided edit of `rowkeys_russian{1,2,3}.xml` or `rowkeys_tatar{1,2,3}.xml` fails here.
 * If the layouts ever need to diverge on purpose, drop the identity and delete this test.
