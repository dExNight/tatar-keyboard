/**
 * The emoji-search query: the text the user types while the search is open.
 *
 * It lives here and nowhere else. The query is NEVER sent to the editor — no `commitText`, no
 * composing region, no `setComposingText` — so nothing the user types while searching can reach the
 * application's text field, and nothing already in that field is read. What the keyboard normally
 * routes into `InputLogic` is diverted into this object for as long as the search is open, and the
 * editor sees only the emoji finally picked, through the ordinary `onTextInput` path.
 *
 * Pure and Android-free, so every rule below is verifiable on the plain JVM: the length bound, the
 * rejection of control characters, code-point-aware backspace (a surrogate pair is one press), and
 * "backspace on an empty query is a request to leave the search".
